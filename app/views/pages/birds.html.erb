		<h2>River Mole</h2>
      Kingfishers can be seen along the length of the river â€“ a flash of blue and
      orange flying swiftly past.

      </p>
      Grey wagtails are also common often seen around
      the Leatherhead Town Bridge and in Winter goosanders can be seen swimming
      along the river.

		<h2>Ponds and streams</h2>
      Many common birds can be seen on our ponds and streams including mallards,
      coots, moorhens, Canada geese, greylag geese and grey wagtails.

      </p>

      In the hedgerows you can see
      yellowhammers and finches and feeding in the fields there are often skylarks
      and thrushes; in the Winter the song and mistle thrushes are joined by
      redwings and fieldfares from Scandinavia.

      (blue, great, coal, long-tailed and marsh), great spotted woodpeckers,
      redpolls and siskins.

		<h2>Urban parks, green spaces and gardens</h2>
      Another rich environment for several species of birds which include:
      green woodpeckers, robins, blackbirds, tits, pied wagtails and many more.

		<h2>Commons and Heaths</h2>
      Our commons and heathlands are home all year round to birds such as finches
      and tits. Rarer summer migrants include woodlarks (Headley Heath),
      nightingales and warblers (Bookham Common).

      <p>
    <%= image_tag("birds/Nightingale.jpg", :alt => "Nightingale", :class => "round") %>
      </p>

      Arguably the most important
      bird site in Mole Valley is Bookham Common for nightingales.
